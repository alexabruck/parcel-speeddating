# A minimal frontend project setup using Parcel

## Getting started

You need to (globally) install a web application bundler named Parcel first, by using yarn or npm.

Yarn:

```bash
yarn global add parcel-bundler
```

npm:

```bash
npm install -g parcel-bundler
```

Run the application by running

```bash
yarn start
```

## What you'll get:

- Transpilation with Babel (Parcel takes care of that)
- Bundling (Parcel takes care of that)
- A dev server with live reloading (Parcel takes care of that)
- Linting
- A Prettier config for consistent formatting (tell your IDE to autoformat on save)
- Cache-busting for assets (Parcel takes care of that)
