# A minimal frontend project setup using Parcel

## Getting started

1. If you haven't yet installed Parcel globally, do it now:

```bash
yarn global add parcel-bundler
```

2. Install the other dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

3. Run the application by running

```bash
yarn start
```

Point your browser to http://localhost:1234/

## What you'll get:

- Transpilation with Babel (Parcel takes care of that)
- Bundling (Parcel takes care of that)
- A dev server with live reloading (Parcel takes care of that)
- Linting
- A Prettier config for consistent formatting (tell your IDE to autoformat on save)
- Cache-busting for assets (Parcel takes care of that)
